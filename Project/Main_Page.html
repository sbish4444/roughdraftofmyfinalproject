    <h1>North Macedonia: A Crossroads of History and Culture</h1>
Nestled in the heart of the Balkan Peninsula, North Macedonia is a small yet historically rich country that bridges East and West. Its landscapes range from serene lakes and rugged mountains to bustling urban centers. Known for its diverse cultural tapestry, North Macedonia is home to a blend of Slavic, Albanian, Turkish, and Roma influences. The country’s past is steeped in antiquity, tracing its roots to the ancient Kingdom of Macedon under Alexander the Great, and shaped by centuries of Byzantine, Ottoman, and Yugoslav rule. Today, North Macedonia stands as a modern state, striving for economic growth and deeper integration into European institutions while preserving its unique heritage.

<h1>Government and Economy</h1>
<h2>Government</h2>
North Macedonia operates as a parliamentary democracy. The President, elected by the public, serves as the head of state with a largely ceremonial role, while the Prime Minister holds executive power and leads the government. The country’s legislature, the Assembly (Sobranie), consists of 120 members elected through proportional representation. Since its peaceful independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, North Macedonia has worked to strengthen its democratic institutions and align itself with Western organizations. It joined NATO in 2020 and remains a candidate for EU membership, with reforms and regional diplomacy, such as the Prespa Agreement with Greece, playing a critical role in its foreign policy.
<br>
<h2>Wealth and Economy</h2>
North Macedonia is classified as an upper-middle-income country, with its economy driven by manufacturing, trade, and agriculture. Key exports include machinery, textiles, and processed foods. The country has an estimated GDP per capita of $7,000 (2023), reflecting moderate economic development. Challenges persist, particularly in reducing unemployment, which hovers around 15%, and addressing regional disparities in wealth. Government policies focus on improving infrastructure, attracting foreign investment, and boosting sectors like tourism, particularly in areas like Lake Ohrid and Pelister National Park. Its diverse population of approximately 2 million includes Macedonians (about 65%), Albanians, Turks, and Roma communities.
<br><br>
<h1>Major Cities</h1>
<h2>Skopje</h2>
Skopje, the capital and largest city, is home to over 500,000 residents and serves as the country's political, economic, and cultural hub. The city is a juxtaposition of ancient heritage and modernity. Its Old Bazaar—one of the largest in the Balkans—dates back to the Ottoman era, while landmarks like the Stone Bridge and Kale Fortress echo its medieval past. The Skopje 2014 urban renewal project reshaped the city’s center with imposing neoclassical buildings and statues, sparking debate over its costs and aesthetic impact. Skopje is also an educational and industrial center, with a vibrant arts scene and a growing tech sector.

Bitola also boasts the ancient ruins of Heraclea Lyncestis, a city founded by Philip II of Macedon. The nearby Pelister National Park, with its unique flora and fauna, is a key attraction for nature enthusiasts.

Ohrid, often referred to as the “Jerusalem of the Balkans,” is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is renowned for Lake Ohrid, one of Europe’s oldest lakes, and its stunning array of medieval churches, including the iconic Church of St. John at Kaneo. With a population of about 40,000, Ohrid attracts visitors with its rich history, tranquil setting, and vibrant summer festivals. The city was once a key religious center and retains its spiritual significance, drawing tourists and pilgrims alike.

<h1>History of North Macedonia</h1>
<h2>Antiquity</h2>
The region was part of the ancient Kingdom of Macedon, ruled by Philip II and his son, Alexander the Great, whose empire shaped the course of world history. After Alexander's death, the territory became a battleground for successor states before becoming part of the Roman and Byzantine empires.
<br><br>
<h2>Ottoman Rule</h2>
From the late 14th century until 1912, Macedonia was under Ottoman rule. During this time, it became a multicultural region with strong Ottoman influences in architecture, religion, and trade. Skopje’s Old Bazaar and mosques, like the Mustafa Pasha Mosque, reflect this legacy.
<br><br>
<h2>The Ilinden Uprising</h2>
The Ilinden Uprising of 1903, led by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), sought autonomy from the Ottoman Empire. Though suppressed, the movement became a cornerstone of Macedonian identity and is celebrated annually on Ilinden Day.
<br><br>
<h2>Macedonia in Yugoslavia</h2>
After the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), Macedonia was incorporated into Serbia and later became a republic within socialist Yugoslavia in 1945. The period was marked by significant economic growth and the formal recognition of Macedonian identity, language, and culture. However, political repression stifled dissent.
<br><br>
<h2>Independence and Modern Era</h2>
North Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. The early years were fraught with economic struggles and ethnic tensions, culminating in a brief conflict with ethnic Albanian insurgents in 2001. The Ohrid Framework Agreement resolved this crisis, granting greater rights to minority communities.
<br><br>
<h2>Skopje 2014</h2>
The Skopje 2014 project, launched in the early 2010s, aimed to reshape the capital’s image with neoclassical architecture, statues, and public squares. While it revitalized parts of the city, critics questioned its cost and controversial aesthetics
